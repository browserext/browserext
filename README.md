# The Browser Extension Specification

âš  Implementation of the technologies discussed and specified in this Community Group is ongoing and none of the original contributors have expressed opposition to this work. However, due to various circumstances, the level of participation has drooped below the level at which productive discussion is possible, and this group has become dormant as a result.

The specifications have therefore not been maintained in a while, and are likely to be out of date. Issues can be raised and comments can be added to existing ones, but timely responses are unlikely at best.

People interested in this work being resumed are encouraged to drum up support among the various implementors.
